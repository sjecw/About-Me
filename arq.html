            <div class="profile-intro">
                
                <p>My name is Sofia Chu! I am a Brazillian student from Rio Grande do Sul and this is my first project working with HTML and CSS! 
                    It has been really interesting to learn new things and develop skills that I grew passionate about.
                    And all this is crazy because I started my journey on February of 2025 and, since then, so much happened and I couldn't be prouder of myself! 
                    I got into the Jovem Talento Tech program and had my first contact with coding and web development.
                    It's been a wonderful experience and I can't wait to see what else I will discover!
